  The idea that graphs and images can be used to express certain quantitative data is a great concept that has been around for a long time. As time has progressed, the ability to display and interpret the information has changed. In the digital humanities, using visual representation to show data can be easier to understand and interpret. With Moretti and Drucker, they both illustrate good points about types of information that can be displayed, and although both are correct for what they can do, Drucker’s idea that it is possible to graph and visualize qualitative data, is slightly far fetched. On the other hand, Moretti’s classic take to using graphs and maps to shows declining trends, or rising genres, that type of data is consistently and accurately representable, and trying to graph something can constantly be changing and is subjective to so many people, seems less consistent and can lead to misinformation. The purpose of this blog post is to illustrate that classic, quantitative visual representation is more consistent and reliable than trying to graph qualitative information and scientific phenomena. 

  When looking at trends, it is very simple to distinguish what you are seeing when the visual is something like a pie chart or a bar graph. The pie chart would show a percentage of something, whereas the bar graph would show information being compared to each other. This is great for showing basic ideas, but in the digital humanities, it's all about thinking and innovating. This leads to more complicated variations of visualizations, one needs to be able to show large amounts of quantitative data while still being able to show clarity. Drucker’s graphs for this idea were useful for what they were trying to show. For example, the graph about demographics of males and females in a country. Drucker showed deeper information, such as adoptions, gender changes, and whatnot. It then started talking about graphing subjective data, which doesn’t make sense because data must remain coherent to remain viable. Subjective data isn’t graphable because it’s entirely personal, and personal feelings or ideas can change at any time, making the recorded data irrelevant. Sure, graphing something such as time is possible because time as we know it moves only in one direction and cannot be altered, so it would be possible to collect data such as that. When Drucker talks about mapping spatiality after a certain event has occurred, in this case a ship crashing, the topography of the beach would change. Yes, originally it would stay the same for a certain amount of time. The wood could rot and fade away, waves could shift the boat entirely, and the recorded data would no longer be correct. This is the problem with graphing qualitative data, there is no guarantee that it will be consistent. These images show the amount of certain words used the most.

The first link is Moretti, and the second is Drucker. Besides the obvious words used in the essays, the main words for Moretti are genres, new, novels, english, and years to name a few. These are all quantitative words, can be tracked and represented accurately through various kinds of media. Drucker on the other hand, besides words like graphical and information which are littered throughout the essay, the main words are interpretation, temporal, experience, data, space, time and subjective, amongst others. A lot of these are qualitative data, which is harder to graph because it has no physicality, and is subjective. It is for this reason why I think Moretti’s approach to showing graphs is better than Druckers. 

  In Morreti’s essay he states that quantitative information is more useful because it is independent of interpretation, meaning that it is what it is, take it as you see it, compared to qualitative data which is interpretive and therefore subjective. I think that this is the correct way to visualize data in the digital humanities because it offers concrete information, and as Moretti says it, independent of interpretation. According to an essay by Stéfan Sinclair, Stan Ruecker, and Milena Radzikowska titled, “Information Visualization for Humanities Scholars” the authors say, “The humanities approach consists not of converging toward a single interpretation that cannot be challenged but rather of examining the objects of study from as many reasonable and original perspectives as possible to develop convincing interpretations.” (Stéfan Sinclair, Stan Ruecker, Milena Radzikowska). I think this quote backs up what Moretti thinks, when he says, “it’s fascinating to see how researchers are convinced that they are all describing something unique (the gender shift, the elevation of the novel, the gentrification, the invention of high and low, the feminization, the sentimental education, the invasion . . .), whereas in all likelihood they are all observing the same comet that keeps crossing and recrossing the sky: the same literary cycle, where gender and genre are probably in synchrony with each other—a generation of military novels, nautical tales, and historical novels à la Scott attracting male writers, one of domestic, provincial and sensation novels attracting women writers, and so on.” These two quotes compliment each other because they are both saying to not focus on things that have already been done trying to get a new result, but take new risks and be original with what you want to examine. It is because of these reasons why I think quantitative information is better for the humanities. 

  In conclusion, both Moretti and Drucker offer compelling arguments and insights into the world of the digital humanities. While I think Moretti’s quantitative approach is more reliable and can have greater value than that of Druckers, it doesn’t mean that Drucker has a bad approach, and is quite inventive which also ties into the earlier quote about trying new things. Overall though, it seems that the qualitative approach hasn’t been fine tuned enough to take over quantitative representation in the digital humanities.
